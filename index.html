          <h1>Welcome to my DayZ Survival Guide</h1>
          <p class="content-box">
            Hey everyone and welcome. My name's Leo, RupyHacker in game. This is my guide to surviving in DayZ Standalone, for at least an hour anways. I remember how frustrating it was when I first got the game and either starved to death, died of thirst or got murdered by a dirty bandit. Now that those dayz are over I want to share with you what I do every time, and I mean every time, I spawn in. Hopefully once you're done reading this DayZ survival guide and trying out what's written you'll be able to survive in DayZ.
          </p>
          <p class="content-box protip">
            IMPORTANT!! If you're an actual DayZ Standalone player and you come accross this page, just note that this was written almost two years ago for a school project. While some is still relevant please take it with a grain of salt as the game was in version 0.45 I believe and things like loot spawns have changed. However, the basics should still help.

          </a>
          <p>
            Ok, so part one of my DayZ survival guide we'll start right at the beginning. You've spawned in and you’re.... where now? Ya, you're on the coast with nothing but your t-shirt, jeans, sneakers and a flashlight with no memory of how you got there. At least Rick Grimes knew where he was and how he got there (** cough ** 28 days later rip-off ** cough **). Lets start here, at the time of writing this (09/2014), the version is 0.48 and we're spawning mainly on the East coast from Svetlojarsk (known commonly as Svet) on the upper north-eastern point of the map down to around Three Valleys between Kamyshovo and Solnichny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you have a basic idea of where you are you need to go inland. Get off the coast and fast. Nothing for you here except death. Either by "Coastal Campers" (bandits that camp the coast on kill freshies) and/or starvation. Two places to avoid at the time of writing is Berezino and Novodmitrovsk (also known as Novo). They are 2 huge cities with some serious death tolls. Just think of them as the South Central and Compton of Chenaurus. Nothing good for you there. You wanna survive standalone? Head inland, keeping out of sight best you can and check houses, barns etc as you go.

          <p>
            Here are a few items you want to find right away
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A warm/waterproof jacket, found in any residential, industrial, farm, military, medical area(so pretty much anywhere)
            </li>
            <li>
              A backpack to store your much earned gear. If you can't find one there are a few ways you can craft one
              <ol>
                <li>You can make a couriers bag from a burlap sac (or wild boar pelt) and some rope</li>
                <li>Or an improvised backpack from the courier bag and some wooden sticks</li>
                <li>And you can also make a leather sac from a deer pelt and a knife</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              And probably one of the most important items, an axe/hatchet(preferably a fire-axe). Here's a few likely spots to find one.
              <ol>
                <li>Residential areas such as houses/apartment buildings and office buildings</li>
                <li>Industrial areas like construction sites, factories and storage units/tool sheds</li>
                <li>Also, along with residential and industrial loot spawns you can find the firemans axe in military loot spawns such as firestations, barracks and ATC towers</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>

            Now that you've made it off the coast in one piece we need to get some food and drink into you. Find some ponds or water pumps and span your center mouse button or "f" key and get some drink into you. At the time of writing these are perfectly safe so drink up till you're full.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now we're so full on water we might puke, we need to find some food. Now at the time of writing you're pretty lucky. It was so hard to find food on populated servers when I first started but we're not going to have that problem. A couple great sources of food are these yellow houses with blue trim and of course grocery stores but of course check every house as you go, you never know what you might find. If you happen to still be full from drinking water wait a few mins before you eat, but if you're not full eat everything you can.
          </p>
          <h3 class="fullheader">But There's No Food Anywhere!!</h3>
          <figure>
            <a href="img/piano-house-full.jpg" data-lightbox="piano-house" data-title="Another great source of supplies including Civilian weapons">

          </figure>
          <p>
            Looked everywhere and can't find anything to eat? Or let me guess, got half a backpack full of canned goods and no can opener? Let's get this figured out. Like I said, surviving in DayZ is a lot easier than when I started. Like when I started you can open cans with pretty much any sharp instrument like your axe, knife or even your screwdriver. However, unlike when I started you have other food sources. There are apple trees everywhere that you can get fresh fruit from along with berry bushes. We can also hunt and fish now but I don't think we have the supplies for that yet. If you do have the supplies give it a shot, I'm not going to get into that now but we will down the road, be sure to check our <a href="updates.php">news &amp; updates</a> page for more tutorials.
          </p>
          <p class="protip">
            [ProTip:Dont hoard food, your stomach is the best for storage when it comes to food and drink]
          </p>
          <p>
            Now just like drinking we're going to eat till we're full and keep drinking also. When you go into your inventory you want to see 2 light green bars that say Hydrated and Energized. Once you got those you'll eventually get one that says Healthy. Once you got those you won't be hungry or thirsty for a long time. Plus you'll heal when you get hit.

          <h2 class="fullheader">Part Three - Hydrated, Energized and Healthy</h2>
          <p>
            Nice, now we’re hydrated, energized and healthy. So now what? Now comes the part we all been waiting for, we're gonna get right geared up. If you took my advice and kept going inland you should be somewhere in the middle of the map. We want to head west to the North West Airfield [NWA], on the southwestern end you're going to find some barracks along with a two-story kind of military jailhouse. In the barracks you may or may not find some sort of military weapon [AK 101, AKM, M4 etc.]. If not don't sweat it; we got plenty other barracks and military bases. Along with weapons and ammo we're looking for military clothing such as vests, hunter backpacks, helmets etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there we're going to head to the hangars. Now your best bet is going to be to go around the southern end of the airfield and stay in the cover of the bushes. This is quite the hot spot, especially since it's damn near impossible to find military grade weapons on the eastern end of the map, so be sure to stay in cover and look over your shoulder. Or if YOLO [hate that word] you can run right across the airstrip. If you choose this route be sure to serpentine [zigzag] so you're not easy to hit.
          </p>
          <h3 class="fullheader">I Made It Across The Airfield!!</h3>
          <p>
            You're heart pumpin yet? It should be. You are so exposed over here and if you're on a populated server there's going to be people coming either from the east from Devils Castle, south from the direction you came from or from the tents north of the airfield [we're heading there next]. Keep looking over you're shoulder.
          </p>
          <p>
            K, now let's search the hangars. In the hangars the loot spawns around the inside of the hangar close to the walls, mainly in the corners along with in the center. You're going to find ammo, attachments med supplies, clothing etc. I should have mentioned this sooner but grab any ammo even if you don't have the weapon it belongs to. You may find the weapon or you can barter with it later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's keep heading up this side of the airfield looting, eating and drinking everything you find and looking over the shoulder as we go. Don't be tempted to run across the airstrip to the buildings on the north eastern side, we'll get there eventually. If you have a weapon kill anyone you come across (or avoid them if you can). Even if you want to play as a friendly player [Hero]. There's no love on Airstrips and in military bases, remember that if you want to survive in DayZ. If anyone says they're friendly they're fuckin lying. As long as you're around military loot consider everyone hostile.
          </p>
          <p>
            So depending on how long the server's been up, you may or may not be geared up by now. If not see those tents up there? Ya? K, they're just like the hangars, we're going to find ammo, attachments for weapons and clothing. Remember to be careful, lots of places to hide or you can get sniped from the north. When we're done here we're heading to the buildings on the other side of the airstrip.

          <p>
            All right so we're going to be one of 3 things by now
            <ol>
              <li>
                Fully geared (including extra mags)
              </li>
              <li>
                Not quite geared (gun but no ammo or vise versa)
              </li>
              <li>
                Or just dead
              </li>
            </ol>
            If you're the first option skip to Step 4. Number 2? Continue reading, or if you're the third start at the beginning (good chance you're going to die here so don't get discouraged.)
          </p>
          <h3 class="fullheader">Let's Head South</h3>

          </figure>
          <p>
            Ok so we're kinda kitted out but not quite. Let's head south. From the northwest airfield you want to head pretty much straight south. This will take you to the Veresnik Military Base. Here you’ll find a big brown barn, a couple barracks and a prison building. This is another hotspot, not as bad as the airfield but it's going to have traffic from north and south. Rules of Engagement apply. Trust no one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still not finding what you need? There's a military base to the south/south east on the south side of Zelenegorsk. You can make a stop at Green Mountain on the way, military loot spawns there also. If you're starting to get hungry/thirsty or need new clothing, Zelenegorsk is a decent sized city. You should have no problem getting filled up on food and drink and some extra supplies while there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then from there, again heading south/south east you'll find the Pavlovo Military base. You'll find office buildings, hospitals and barracks here.

            <p>
              Ok, so we're nearing the end of my DayZ Survival Guide. By now we should be geared up, hydrated, energized and healthy. Now, let's go find some people. No matter where you are you can head east. At the time of writing all the action is in Novo and Berezino. However in the 0.49 update the southern spawns will be back in so I'm going to imagine it'll be like old DayZ again with the action in Elektozavodsk [Elekto] and Chernogorsk [Cherno] along with Berezino and Novo. Lotsa action. If you are reading this after the southern spawns are in everything applies, get off the coast, however obviously you want to head North instead of west.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fullheader center">The End</h2>
            <p>
              So that brings us to the end of this DayZ Survival guide. I hope you enjoyed it or it helped you. Just remember if you made it this far that this guide was written for version 0.45.
